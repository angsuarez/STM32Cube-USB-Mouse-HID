  - Four LEDs will show moving direction at the same time 
  
  @ Hardware and Software environment    
  - This porject runs on STM32F4 Discovery board for STM32F407x Devices
  - Initial code was generated by STM32CubeMX from F4USBHID.ioc
  - It's a full project of Keil MDK-ARM V5 
    
  @ How to use it?
  - Connect USB cable to CN1 of STM32F4 Discovery board 
  - Rebuild project and load the output image into flash memory
  - Connect the STM32F4 Discovery board CN5 to PC through 'USB micro A-Male 
    A-Male' cable 
	
  A new USB mouse will be found from PC Device Manager
  You can modify source code for future applications
